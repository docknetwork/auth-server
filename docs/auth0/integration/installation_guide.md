# Sign in with Dock Web3 ID - Auth0 Integration

The Dock Web3 ID integration allows users to privately sign in to your app using [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://docs.api.dock.io/#dids) & [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.dock.io/) via scanning QR codes with their Dock Wallet apps. This step-by-step guide will show you how to integrate Dock Web3 ID into your authentication flow easily.

## Under the Hood

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are cryptographically verifiable pseudonymous identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. When a user creates an account in the Dock Wallet app, a DID will automatically be created for them.

DIDs contain no personal data about the user. An example of a DID stored on the Dock blockchain could look like this:

![sample-did](../media/DID%20example.jpg)

Each DID is supported by a Public-Private cryptographic key pair.

When a user scans the QR Code generated by the Dock Web3 ID Auth0 integration, the user’s Private Key associated with the DID digitally signs a Verifiable Credential. This Verifiable Credential contains a cryptographic hash that ensures that it wasn’t modified since it was created and signed.

This Authentication Verifiable Credential is sent to Dock, who verifies that the Credential was indeed cryptographically signed by the correct user and grants the user access to the app.

Coming soon, users will be able to create multiple DIDs and update their keys in the Dock Wallet app.

## Prerequisites

1. An Auth0 account and tenant. [Sign up for free here](https://auth0.com/signup).

## Set up Login with Dock Web3 ID

Register for a Client ID and Client Secret by posting a REST request like the following to the Dock auth server <https://auth.dock.io/register>.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://auth.dock.io/register -d '{"name": "My App", "website": "https://www.my-app.org", "redirect_uris":["https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/login/callback"]}'
```

NOTE: You can get your Auth0 domain from the **Settings** tab on the **Application** page

You will get back a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "client_id": "jT4iswsxJsoHLbMXjKECcdGeXMaGowc6IIB/YRYspJqkuYEAynhUNQUOVMosGxwjJ5/DKNMafsmupXiA26GfceUIorCIlQDo+f7iq/H7MFtkfDBkKnW1iUEOcC/9nP2E",
  "client_secret": "8z+zGijpdnR33bON+8IOQKXdX2Eg6rn0mwksis0dz22fv5UMToGbjazcGNRM1Ary"
}
```

## Add the Connection

1. Use the **Add Integration** button above to start.
2. Read the necessary access requirements and click `Continue`.
3. Configure the integration with the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you received in the [Login with Dock Registration](#setup-login-with-dock-web3-id) steps.
4. Select the **Permissions** needed for your applications
5. Turn off **Sync user profile attributes at each login**
6. Click `Create`
7. On the **Applications** tab choose the application you setup in the [Auth0 Registration](#auth0-registration) steps to enable "Sign in with DockID" for that application.

## Test connection
